 DL_POLY Quantum additonal program for calculating velocity and dipole autocorrelation
 functions and resulting diffusion coefficients and absorption spectra, respectively

 Requires FFTW3 package for performing Fourier transform

 Authors - Nathan London, Dil Limbu, and Md Omar Faruque

Compile using make, ensure FFTW3 package is linked in Makefile

Updated to use dipole derivative in spectra calculations
-set number of molecules to be 1 when using updated DL_POLY that uses total cell dipole
  instead of molecular dipoles

Running the program:
-Required files:
	- CONTROL file detailing calculation options (see example directory)
	- CORDIP/CORVEL files for each trajectory in a seperate directory labeled as traj001,
			traj002, etc (see example directory for directory generation bash script, 
			setup.sh)

Can be run in parallel using mpirun
