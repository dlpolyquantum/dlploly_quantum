This directory contains example scripts for performing 
hybrid-centroid molecular dynamics (h-CMD) simulations 
the system of lithium TFSI in water.

Included are:
-DL_POLY input files for reference PIMD simulations and
  classical simulations with corrected potential for both
  IBI sampling and production runs
-Automation scripts for setting up IBI iterations and 
  submitting simulations to HPC clusters using SLURM 
  schedulers
-Python script for fitting correction potentials during
  IBI
