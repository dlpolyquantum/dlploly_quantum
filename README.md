## DL_POLY-Quantum-v2.0

DL_POLY Quantum v2.0 is a general purpose open-source software package developed by Nathan London, Dil K. Limbu, Mohammad R. Momeni, and Farnaz A. Shakib for molecular dynamics simulations in condensed phases subject to nuclear quantum effects.

DL_POLY Quantum v2.0 is an updated version of DL_POLY Quantum v1.0 which was developed by Mohammad R. Momeni and Farnaz A. Shakib at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. DL_POLY Quantum v1.0, in turn, was a modified version of DL_POLY Classic v1.10 originally developed in the Daresbury Laboratory.

A manual will be provided here in the near future. See the README file for instructions on how to compile the code. Test jobs are provided in the data subdirectory.

For questions and feedbacks please contact Dr. Momeni (mmomenitaheri@umkc.edu) or Dr. Shakib (shakib@njit.edu).
